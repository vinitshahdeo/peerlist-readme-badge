# Social Summer Of Code (SSoC)

This project is shortlisted for a three-months-long Open Source Program([Social Summer Of Code](https://ssoc.devfolio.co/)) Organized By Social in order to promote open source with new age technologies & help beginners to kickstart their open-source journey. Please get started by introducing yourself [here](https://github.com/vinitshahdeo/peerlist-readme-badge/discussions/6).

## Contribution Guide

If you're a participant of [Social Summer Of Code](https://ssoc.devfolio.co/)(SSoC), please branch off from `feature/web-app` and raise a PR to `feature/web-app`. Currently this branch contains a `client` directory which contains a basic React boilerplate which can be developed further as a React app to generate Peerlist badges dynamically. In case, you have other frameworks in mind, please checkout a branch `feature/web-app-<your framework>` from `develop` and create your app within `client` directory. For building UI, take inspiration from [Badges Generator](https://badgesgenerator.com/) and [Shields.io](https://shields.io/).
